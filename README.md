# current-spotify-track-custom-twitch-command

##Add your own twitch custom command for viewers to get your currently playing spotify track

A quick and dirty go app to add a custom command in order to get the currently playing spotify track of the authed user.

Most of the variables come from the environment, the only thing that needs to be altered is the command (within the handleTwitchMessages func).

Will probably improve it at some point. Or maybe not, who knows :)

Enjoy
