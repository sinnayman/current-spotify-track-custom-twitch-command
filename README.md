# current-spotify-track-custom-twitch-command

### Add your own twitch custom command for viewers to get your currently playing spotify track

Most of the variables come from the environment, the only thing that needs to be altered is the command (within the handleTwitchMessages func).

Will probably improve it at some point. Or maybe not, who knows :)

Enjoy
